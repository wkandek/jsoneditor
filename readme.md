I used Claude Code, took about 4 hours to come up with the following python application. 
http://jsonedit.kandek.com:5001/

I then resued the prompts with OpenAI codex and it came up with this program: 
http://jsonedit.kandek.com:8000/ - tooks about 2 hours

Both had issues in different parts of the application that required me to tell it something was wrong.
We then iterated to find a working version.
I did not hand code anything.
